# Using Alembic with Timeline

You can use Timeline to play back and record Alembic animation including:

* Creating sequences [using Alembic clips](time_AlembicShot.html), including trimming times and adjusting clip-ins. 
* Playing Alembic animation [using imported animation clips](time_ImportedClip.html).
* Playing Alembic animation by [controlling the Alembic Stream Player component](time_InfiniteClip.html) through an Infinite clip. This takes a little longer to set up than using an Alembic clip, but you can easily convert an Infinite clip to an Animation clip to use in an Animator controller (state machine).
