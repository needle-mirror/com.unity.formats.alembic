# Controlling Alembic playback

You can customize importing and playing back Alembic data through the properties on the [Alembic Stream Player component](ref_StreamPlayer.html). 

When you change the **Time** parameter you can see the Alembic objects moving. To play the animation, you can control the **Time** parameter from the [Timeline](timeline.html) window, [Animation](animClip.html) window, or via scripts.

**Vertex Motion Scale** is a magnification factor when calculating velocity. The greater the velocity and motion scale, the more blurring the [Motion Blur post-processing effect](matshad.html#blur) applies.
